					<p>
						i always want to create new and unique things. getting into app
						development has changed me a lot, and since then, i try to push my
						work to the new whole level with each project. i always put quality
						first. for each project i work on, i pay particular attention to the
						interaction, animations and (obviously) performances. this is just
						the beginning, and i really canâ€™t wait to push my limit even further
						by working with you on our next project. i usually want my work use
						less third parties library, it allows me to feel a complete freedom
						and also i want to test my competence, creativity, and imagination.
