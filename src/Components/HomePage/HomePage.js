					<p>
						i always want to explore. getting into app development has changed
						me a lot, and since then, i try to push myself and especially my
						work to the new whole level with each project. quality first, for
						each project i work on, i pay particular attention to the
						interaction, animations and (obviously) performances. THIS IS JUST
						THE BEGINNING, and i really canâ€™t wait to push my limit even further
						by working with you on our next project. i usually want my work use
						less third parties library, it allows me to feel a complete freedom
						and also i want to test myself, my competence, my creativity, and my
						imagination.
